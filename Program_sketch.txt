Program sketch: Oregonator in space


Concentration now a function of time (discrete) and location (discrete).

The reaction class will be initialized by:

creating the state as an array of concentrations for each combination of spatial co-ordinates,
for each species

a time variable


The class will need:

 a function to time-evolve the spatial concentrations (according to Fick's law)  


 a function to time-evolve the reactions. This needs to be done at every discrete point in the space

a function to append the current state to a file for storage


the reaction can be run by repeatedly calling these 3 functions (in the given order) whilst advancing the time.
